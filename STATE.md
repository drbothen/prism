| ID | Decision | Rationale | Phase | Date |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|------|
| D-047 | OrgRegistry declared in prism-core (not a new crate) — re-uses uuid_v7_newtype! macro pattern; no crate proliferation. | Consistent with existing prism-core newtype conventions; avoids circular deps | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-048 | CrowdStrike session_registry re-keyed to (OrgId, device_id) composite — session_registry is per-org scoped in S-3.2.03. | Isolation boundary matches the per-org state segregation rule (BC-3.2.001) | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-049 | NVD and ThreatIntel DTUs accept OrgId as optional — shared global cache model; OrgId used for audit tagging only (not isolation). | NVD/ThreatIntel data is not org-private; audit trail still requires OrgId annotation | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-050 | OrgRegistry.register() is idempotent for duplicate slug+uuid pairs — returns Ok(()) on exact duplicate; returns Err(DuplicateSlug) only on slug collision with different uuid. | Simplifies boot path (customers/*.toml loaded in arbitrary order) | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-051 | demo-server excludes orgs from OrgRegistry by default — demo-server injects a synthetic "demo" org only; real customer orgs not registered at boot. | Preserves demo-server isolation from production customer config | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-052 | Empty display_name in customer TOML triggers E-CFG-001 validation error — display_name is a required non-empty string field. | Explicit config validation prevents silent misconfigurations | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-053 | spec_path field in customer TOML validated for existence during startup validator pass — missing spec paths are hard errors, not warnings. | Fail-fast at boot; prevents runtime sensor-spec-not-found errors per BC-3.3.002 | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-054 | Schema derivation for Armis and CrowdStrike is a pre-story (S-3.7.00) — S-3.7.04/05 depend on S-3.7.00 to provide Rust types before generator implementation. | Separates schema derivation complexity from generator logic; enables parallel review | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-055 | default_page_size() is a per-sensor constant on the DataSource trait — used by PaginationEdgeCases harness to derive expected page boundaries deterministically. | Avoids hardcoding sensor-specific constants in test harness | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-056 | Archetype catalog module lives in prism-dtu-common behind a feature gate (feature = "generator") — not compiled into production DTU binaries. | Keeps production binary size minimal; generators are test-only infrastructure | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-057 | CAP-036 (Multi-Tenant DTU Test Harness) and CAP-037 (Workspace Crate Layout Convention) added to capabilities.md v1.6 — anchored to BC-3.5.*/BC-3.6.* and BC-3.7.001 respectively. | Capability registry kept in sync with new Wave 3 contracts per VSDD policy | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-058 | Parallel DTU startup latency budget: 200ms p99 for 4-org fan-out — per BC-3.2.004 NFR. Applies to both logical and network isolation modes. | Analyst-facing query latency must not degrade with multi-tenant load | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-059 | RocksDB record IDs prefixed with org slug for human readability — slug-based prefix on CF keys in multi-tenant column families. | Debuggability: log entries and admin inspections show org context without UUID decode | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-060 | BC-3.7.001 (src/ convention) cross-cuts all subsystems — assigned to SS-01 (**Sensor Adapters**) as the workspace-wide convention owner; enforced via CI gate in S-3.5.01. | Workspace conventions are not subsystem-specific; SS-01 is the natural owner | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-061 | Phase 3.A spec authoring complete — 7 ADRs (006-012) + 21 BCs (BC-3.1.001-BC-3.7.001) + **37 stories** (S-3.0.01/02, S-3.1.01-07, S-3.2.01-08, S-3.3.01-06, S-3.4.01-05, S-3.5.01, S-3.6.01/02, S-3.7.00-05) + 2 CAPs (036, 037) all on disk at v0.2 PROPOSED / status: draft. Pre-compact handoff prepared (STATE.md v5.36, SESSION-HANDOFF.md v5.36, wave-state.yaml updated). Convergence deferred to post-compact. NO IMPLEMENTATION until convergence + human approval (D-045). **CORRECTION (D-062):** original handoff stated "16 stories" — this was an undercount. Consistency-validator surfaced the correct count of 35 MT stories. **(CORRECTION D-065: +2 stories (S-3.3.06, S-3.2.08) added by spec-reviewer Step 2 — corrected total is 37 stories (35 from initial authoring + 2 from D-065).)** **(CORRECTION: 22 BCs — original 21 figure was an undercount; verified by BC-INDEX summary and D-105.)** | Pre-compact handoff milestone — spec authoring phase ended cleanly | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-062 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A consistency convergence — Step 1 of 7-step convergence. Consistency-validator FAILED with 5 BLOCKING + 6 DRIFT items. Fixes applied: BC-3.3.001 (ADR-010 variant) renamed to BC-3.3.004; BC-INDEX bumped v4.14→v4.15 with 22 Wave 3 BCs (total 230, active 222); STORY-INDEX bumped v1.55→v1.56 with 35 MT stories (correcting earlier 16-story claim in D-061); ADR-006 related_bcs_planned augmented with BC-3.2.003, BC-3.2.004; 16 BCs version-aligned to v0.2; S-3.7.04/05 frontmatter completed with BC-3.4.003. wave-state.yaml MT story list added. Verdict pending re-validation. Pre-fix factory: 01bc8174 → Stage 1: 066b5768 → Stage 2 backfill: this commit. | Consistency-validator found cross-reference and count discrepancies requiring PO + story-writer + state-manager coordinated fix pass | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-063 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A consistency-fix Pass 2 — re-validation found 3 new MAJOR: NEW-1 BC-INDEX had 10 Wave 3 BC rows with wrong subsystem/CAP columns; NEW-2 ADR-010 related_bcs_planned missing BC-3.3.004; NEW-3 S-3.7.00 + S-3.7.02 frontmatter (behavioral_contracts, anchor_bcs, inputs + BC table) missing BC-3.4.003. All 3 resolved. BC-INDEX bumped v4.15→v4.16. Pre-fix factory: 830bc037 → Stage 1: b581e0ff → Stage 2 backfill: this commit. | Re-validation surfaced subsystem/CAP column errors and missing BC cross-references requiring second PO + story-writer + state-manager fix pass | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-064 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A consistency re-validation Pass 3: PASS (0 BLOCK + 1 DRIFT). DRIFT-7 (STORY-INDEX BC-INDEX pin v4.15 → v4.16) fixed in micro-burst. STORY-INDEX v1.56→v1.57. Pre-fix factory: 9e262ddb → Stage 1: d65e750f → Stage 2: 3b4b6dcf. Convergence Step 1 COMPLETE — proceed to Step 2 (spec-reviewer). | Consistency-validator Pass 3 clean except for one stale version pin; micro-burst closes DRIFT-7 and completes Step 1 of the convergence sequence | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-065 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A spec-reviewer Step 2 — STRONG verdict with 5 critical fixes required. Critical findings C-1 (BC postcondition desync from Decision Refinements), C-2 (allow_shared_override 3-state contradiction), C-3 (no story for reload_config mode rejection), C-4 (no story for CrowdStrike session OrgId scoping), C-5 (14 BCs incorrectly anchored to CAP-009). Fixes applied: 13 BCs bumped v0.2→v0.3, 5 ADRs updated, 3 new CAPs added (CAP-038 Multi-Tenant Identity, CAP-039 Multi-Tenant Fixture Gen, CAP-040 Multi-Tenant Adapter Dispatch), 2 new stories (S-3.3.06, S-3.2.08), allow_shared_override DEFERRED to Wave 4 per ADR-007 §7 OQ-1. Pre-fix factory: a8002734 → Stage 1: ace406d9 → Stage 2: 3b4b6dcf. | spec-reviewer surfaced 5 critical spec gaps requiring coordinated PO + story-writer + state-manager fix burst before adversary pass | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-066 | allow_shared_override locked DEFERRED to Wave 4 — Wave 3 ST guard is unconditional. ADR-007 §7 OQ-1 resolved. Adversary review must accept this scope. | Wave 3 scope bounded to unconditional startup rejection guard; allow_shared_override complexity deferred to Wave 4 where full config-reload story exists | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-067 | CAP-038/039/040 added — multi-tenant capabilities split out from CAP-009 (Client Configuration). CAP-009 retains pure config-loading scope. CAP-038 = Multi-Tenant Identity; CAP-039 = Multi-Tenant Fixture Gen; CAP-040 = Multi-Tenant Adapter Dispatch. 10 BCs re-anchored from CAP-009 to correct capability anchor. | CAP-009 was overloaded with unrelated multi-tenant contracts; splitting into 3 focused CAPs improves traceability and prevents future anchor collisions | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-068 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A consistency Pass 4 verdict: PASS with 3 minor DRIFT — DRIFT-1: E-3.2 epic header showed 7 stories instead of 8 (STORY-INDEX v1.58→v1.59 corrects count); DRIFT-2: ADR-011 §8 OQ-1 open question not marked RESOLVED despite decision having been made (ADR-011 §8 OQ-1 note appended); DRIFT-3: 6 BC traces_to arrays used stale ["CAP-009"] format instead of ADR file paths (BC-3.4.001-004 → ADR-009 file path; BC-3.3.002/003 → ADR-010 file path). All 3 DRIFT resolved. Pre-fix factory: eddbf11c → Stage 1: 891a118a → Stage 2: 3b4b6dcf. Convergence Step 2 (spec-reviewer) COMPLETE — proceed to Step 3 (adversary Pass 1). | Consistency-validator Pass 4 caught frontmatter format drift and stale cross-references; micro-burst closes all DRIFT before adversary pass | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-069 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A adversary Pass 1 verdict: OPEN (4 critical + 9 major + 7 minor + 3 process-gap). Fix burst applied: C-001 ADR-010 §2.7 archetype examples corrected to PascalCase ADR-009 names; C-002 BC-3.3.001/004 reconciled to D-051 (demo-server in DTU_DEFAULT_MODE with test_only); C-003 +74 Wave 3 VPs registered in VP-INDEX as flat numeric VP-063..VP-136 with [BC-3.X.Y] reference tags; C-004 ARCH-INDEX expanded with ADR-005..012 in ADR Registry. M-001..M-009 major findings addressed. m-001..m-007 minor findings addressed. Pre-fix factory: bab7589e → Stage 1: bda40374 → Stage 2: 3b4b6dcf. Pass 2 dispatch pending. | Adversary Pass 1 surfaced critical VP namespace gaps and archetype naming inconsistencies; fix burst closes all critical and major findings before Pass 2 | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-070 | M-003 fix: STATE.md D-060 subsystem name corrected from 'Core' to 'Sensor Adapters' per ARCH-INDEX SS-01 canonical name. Entry text updated in this commit. | Subsystem name in decision log must match ARCH-INDEX registry; M-003 catch from adversary Pass 1 | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-071 | Wave 3 VP namespace resolution: dotted-form VP-X.Y.Z-NN initially used in BC bodies during Phase 3.A authoring; resolved by registering all Wave 3 VPs in VP-INDEX as flat numeric VP-063..VP-136 with [BC-3.X.Y] reference tags. Story citations propagated to flat form by story-writer (STORY-INDEX v1.59→v1.60). Future Wave 3 VPs continue flat numeric scheme. P-001 [process-gap] from adversary Pass 1 RESOLVED. | Flat numeric VP namespace is the established VSDD convention; dotted-form was a Phase 3.A authoring drift caught by adversary; propagation to story citations completes the resolution | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-072 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A adversary Pass 2 verdict: OPEN (3 critical + 6 major + 4 minor + 1 process-gap). Pass 1 fix burst left arithmetic propagation gaps in 5 anchor docs (verification-architecture/coverage/BC-INDEX-Summary/STORY-INDEX-frontmatter/STORY-INDEX-overview) — surfaced and fixed in Pass 2 burst. Pre-fix factory: 9af18397. Pass 3 dispatch pending. | Arithmetic propagation gaps from Pass 1 fix burst corrected across all anchor documents | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-073 | M-002 fix: E-CFG-013 dual-binding eliminated. R-CUST-013 retains E-CFG-013 (test-only type rejection). New R-CUST-014 / E-CFG-014 added for missing-spec on client-mode. | Dual-binding for a single error code is a contract violation; split cleanly into separate R-CUST entries with distinct error codes | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-074 | M-004 fix: DTU_DEFAULT_MODE struct widened to DtuRegistryEntry { type_name, default_mode, test_only }. Per ADR-007 §2.3 v0.5. Compatible with D-051 demo-server test_only annotation. | Per-crate constant approach abandoned per ADR-007 Rationale (§2.3 reject scattered classification); centralized registry in prism-core per D-047 | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-075 | S-3.0.02 scope clarification (m-004): per-crate constant approach abandoned per ADR-007 Rationale (§2.3 reject scattered classification). Centralized DTU_DEFAULT_MODE registry in prism-core per D-047. S-3.0.02 v0.1→v0.2. | Ensures implementation story matches centralized registry decision from D-047 / ADR-007 | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-076 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A adversary Pass 3 verdict: OPEN (1C+5M+4m+1PG). Sibling-fix propagation gaps from Pass 2 surfaced and fixed: C-001 BC-3.4.004 hex-prefix fallback removed (matches ADR-009 §2.5 v0.4); M-001 verification-architecture catalog VP-095..098 method=unit_test; M-002 VP-083 dedup in coverage-matrix; M-003 19 BCs Stories: TBD→concrete S-IDs; M-004 5 BCs VP-TBD-N→VP-122..136; M-005 ADR-011 +SS-01.

Pass 4 dispatch pending. | Adversary Pass 3 surfaced sibling-fix propagation gaps from Pass 2 burst; all C+M findings fixed before Pass 4 | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-077 | ADR-008 anchored_capabilities corrected from CAP-038 → CAP-001, CAP-004 (matches BC-3.2.001/002/003 anchors). Triangle ADR↔BC↔CAP coherent (m-002). | anchored_capabilities must match actual BC anchor fields; CAP-038 was introduced in Pass 2 burst for multi-tenant identity but ADR-008 DTU state segregation BCs anchor to CAP-001/004 | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-078 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A adversary Pass 4 verdict: OPEN (1C+4M+3m+1PG). Findings count decreasing. Fixes applied: C-001 error-taxonomy.md E-CFG renumber (old 001..004 → 100..103; new 001..014 from BC-3.3.004 R-CUST); M-001 VP-INDEX Proptest P0/P1 64/13; M-002 verification-architecture P0/P1 113/23; M-003 ADR-008/009 +SS-01; M-004 +VP-094 in I3 enumeration; m-001 ADR-010 +anchored_capabilities; m-002 flat-form VP IDs propagated to BC-3.2.005/3.3.004/3.4.004; m-003 coverage-matrix HTML comment + Coverage Gaps.

| D-079 | C-001 fix: E-CFG-001..004 renumbered to E-CFG-100..103; E-CFG-001..014 namespace now reserved for BC-3.3.004 startup-validation errors. error-taxonomy.md is now canonical source for all 18 error codes. | E-CFG-001..004 (original codes) collided with the new E-CFG-001..014 namespace introduced by BC-3.3.004 R-CUST-001..014; renumbering to 100..103 resolves the namespace conflict cleanly | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-080 | ADR↔CAP↔BC anchored_capabilities convention: parent ADRs (ADR-006, ADR-007) include only the 'primary' capability they create; transitive child capabilities (CAP-001, CAP-004, CAP-007, CAP-009) are reached via child ADRs (ADR-008, ADR-010). Documented in capabilities.md v1.8 changelog. Resolves Pass 5 M-003. | Prevents anchored_capabilities bloat on parent ADRs; child ADRs are the canonical anchors for derived capabilities; cross-referencing is transitive via ADR dependency chain | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-081 | Wave 3 Phase 3.A adversary Pass 5 verdict: OPEN (1C+4M+4m+0PG). Cross-ref audit 6 categories: CAP-001/004/007/009 +BC reverse pointers, 5 stale BC traces_to, 12 BC title-case drift, 44 story BC-title propagations.

| D-082 | BC-3.3.004 R-CUST-015 + E-CFG-015 added: spec file existence check (validates [[dtu]].spec path resolves to a real file). Closes m-002 from Pass 5. | Spec path existence was checked at ADR level (D-053) but not codified as an explicit BC rule with its own error code; adding R-CUST-015/E-CFG-015 closes the gap | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-083 | Pass 6 verdict: OPEN (1C+3M+5m). Critical C-001: VP-INDEX 9 Wave 3 VP anchor stories were wrong/nonexistent (VP-122-127 should be S-3.3.03/04 not S-3.5.01/02; VP-134-136 should be S-3.5.01 not S-3.7.01). Comprehensive 74-VP audit confirmed no other mismatches. Major M-001 VP-135 module mis-attribution; M-002 R-CUST-016/E-CFG-016 added (mode=shared+spec); M-003 7 ADR frontmatter titles → title-case.

| D-084 | E-CFG-017 added for Security Telemetry + shared mode rejection (was uncoded prose in BC-3.3.001 EC-008). Now 17 R-CUST Wave 3 codes (E-CFG-001..017) + 4 schema/literal Wave 3 codes (E-CFG-000/020/030/031) + 4 pre-Wave 3 codes (E-CFG-100..103) = 25 codes total in error-taxonomy v1.10. | Uncoded prose in EC-008 meant the error was not machine-verifiable and not traceable to a test vector; explicit error code closes the gap | 3 | 2026-04-27 |
| D-085 | Pass 7 verdict: OPEN (0C+2M+5m+0PG). Findings count significantly improved from Pass 6 (1C+3M+5m). Critical=0 — first pass with no critical findings.

| D-098 | Wave 3 supplement to Wave 1-2 specs: VP-001 description and architecture summary docs updated to OrgId/OrgSlug terminology. TenantId remains a deprecation alias per ADR-006 §4 Step 2 until Wave 4. | OrgId/OrgSlug is the canonical Wave 3 terminology per D-041/ADR-006; pre-Wave-3 docs that retained TenantId language create confusion for implementors; sweep closes the terminology gap | 3 | 2026-04-27 |

## Wave 3 Plan

Approved 2026-04-27. Phase 3.A spec authoring is BLOCKING — no implementation until ADRs 006-012, BCs 3.1.*-3.7.*, story decomposition, and spec convergence (3 clean passes + consistency-validator + spec-reviewer + drift check) all complete and human-approved (D-045).

| Epic | Scope | Estimate | Key Decisions |
|------|-------|----------|---------------|
| E-3.1: OrgId/OrgSlug split + translation layer | `OrgId` (UUID v7) + `OrgSlug` (kebab) + `OrgRegistry` translation; dual-persist in audit entries | 5-7 days | D-041 |
| E-3.2: Multi-tenant DTU state segregation | Per-org DTU state isolation; logical + network isolation modes in-wave | 5-7 days | D-042, D-044 |
| E-3.3: Customer config schema + harness | Customer TOML `[[dtu]] mode = shared\|client`; config validation harness | 5-7 days | D-042 |
| E-3.4: Test migration to harness | Migrate existing tests to new multi-tenant test harness | 3-4 days | D-043 |
| E-3.5: src/ convention sweep | Standardize source layout conventions across workspace | 0.5-1 day | — |
| E-3.6: HS-006/HS-007 refresh | Refresh holdout scenarios referencing retired BCs (TD-HOLDOUT-W2-002) | 1-2 days | — |
| E-3.7: Multi-tenant data generator | Hybrid archetype catalog + deterministic generator; schema-grounded against 1898 repo specs | 5-7 days | D-043 |
| Quick fix-PR (pre-Wave-3): shared/client mode metadata on existing 7 DTUs | Validates BC-3.2.005 baseline; 0.5 day | — | D-042 |
| Quick fix-PR: lefthook fmt hook fix (TD-W2-FIX-H-001) | First Wave 3 implementation PR | — | — |

**Phase 3.A gate:** architect → spec-writer → story-writer → spec convergence → human approval → implementation begins.

## Session Resume Checkpoint (2026-04-27-wave-3-phase-3a-adversary-pass-21-fix-burst)

_Previous checkpoints (Passes 4–20) archived: see [cycles/wave-3-multi-tenant/session-checkpoints.md](cycles/wave-3-multi-tenant/session-checkpoints.md)_

**TL;DR:** Wave 3 Phase 3.A adversary Pass 21 fix burst applied. Verdict OPEN (0C+1M+4m+2PG; 14th consecutive 0-critical; 1-major significantly down from 2-4 prior). M-21-001 ocsf-proto-gen +COMP-013 + footnote fix; m-21-001 4-site cross-cutting note +SS-21 (ADR-012/BC-3.7.001/capabilities); m-21-002 BC-3.7.001 v0.6 changelog row; m-21-003 STATE/SESSION-HANDOFF stale counts (35→37, 21→22 BCs); m-21-004 SESSION-HANDOFF duplicate paragraphs removed; PG-21-001 burst-log Pass 17-20 archival; PG-21-002 wave-state.yaml version comments refreshed. D-109. STATE v5.60→v5.61. Pre-fix: a74f981a; canonical: 15fa97e6 (Stage 1 placeholder).

**RESUME PATH:**
1. adversary Pass 22 — fresh-context re-review — NEXT
2. Repeat until 3 consecutive CLEAN passes
3. /vsdd-factory:check-input-drift — input-hash drift check
4. Human approval gate — recommend ADRs → ACCEPTED
5. First implementation: S-3.0.01 (lefthook fmt fix)

**Current artifact status:**
- 7 ADRs: ADR-007 v0.10; ADR-010 v0.10; ADR-011 v0.11; ADR-012 v0.10; others v0.5–v0.9; SS-21 in frontmatter
