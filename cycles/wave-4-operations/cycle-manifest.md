## Notes

### Wave 4 Charter

**Theme:** Operations layer — schedule execution, detection rules, alerting, case management, action delivery.
**Crate:** `prism-operations`
**Entry baseline:** develop@ba3b10c7 (Wave 3 CONVERGED 2026-05-02) / factory-artifacts@b3a9d5bf

Wave 4 introduces the operations runtime: scheduled sensor polling, differential result packs, detection rule evaluation, alert generation, case lifecycle management, and outbound action delivery. This is the first wave that produces externally-visible operational outputs (alerts, cases, notifications).

### Wave 4 Story Inventory

8 stories — all status: draft, all P0.

| Story | Title | Pts | BCs | VPs | Layer | Depends On |
|-------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-------|------------|
| S-4.01 | Schedule CRUD and Execution Loop | 5 | 5 | VP-026, VP-030 | 3 | S-3.02, S-2.01 |
| S-4.02 | Differential Results and Packs | 5 | 2 | VP-019 | 2 | S-4.01 |
| S-4.03 | Detection Rule Loading and Compilation | 8 | 5 | VP-018 | 3 | S-3.02, S-1.08, S-2.01 |
| S-4.04 | Detection Evaluation (Single/Correlation/Sequence) | 5 | 5 | VP-027 | 3 | S-4.03 |
| S-4.05 | Alert Generation | 1 | 2 | VP-028 | 1 | S-4.04 |
| S-4.06 | Case Management | 9 | 5 | VP-052/53/54/60 | 3 | S-4.05, S-2.01 |
| S-4.07 | Case Metrics + Acknowledge Alert | 3 | 3 | — | 2 | S-4.06 |
| S-4.08 | Action Delivery Framework | 9 | 5 | VP-044/45/46/47 | 3 | S-4.05, S-4.06, S-4.01, S-1.15, S-6.11/12/13 |

**Total story points:** 45
**Total BCs covered:** ~32 unique (per STORY-INDEX wave-4 raw count = 45)

### Topology / Dispatch Order

```
ENTRY (parallel — both depend only on merged Wave 1-3):
├─ S-4.01 (Schedule CRUD)
└─ S-4.03 (Detection Rule Loading)

CHAIN A (Schedule -> Diff):
S-4.01 -> S-4.02

CHAIN B (Detection -> Alert -> Case -> Metrics):
S-4.03 -> S-4.04 -> S-4.05 -> S-4.06 -> S-4.07

TERMINAL (Action Delivery — joins both chains + DTU deps):
S-4.05 + S-4.06 + S-4.01 + S-1.15 + S-6.11/12/13 -> S-4.08
```

Parallelism opportunities:
- **Group A (entry):** {S-4.01, S-4.03} — dispatch simultaneously after pre-flight green
- **Group B (mid):** {S-4.02 after 4.01, S-4.04 after 4.03} — dispatch simultaneously when respective dependencies merge
- **Group C (mid-late):** {S-4.05 after 4.04}
- **Group D (terminal):** {S-4.06 + S-4.07 chain}, then {S-4.08 after all join conditions met}

### Pre-Flight Checklist (BLOCKING before story dispatch)

| Check | Owner | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Spec-drift audit on 8 W4 stories | spec-drift-analyzer | NOT_STARTED | Stories drafted 2026-04-16/17 — predates Wave 2/3 implementations |
| Uncertainty scanner on each story | uncertainty-scanner | NOT_STARTED | Verify library versions, API claims, container references |
| Story re-validation (status: draft -> ready) | product-owner / story-writer | NOT_STARTED | Update each story to current architecture state |
| BC anchor validation against current BC-INDEX | product-owner | NOT_STARTED | Verify retired BC refs |
| TenantId -> OrgId references in story bodies | story-writer | NOT_STARTED | Per D-041; alias retained Wave 3 per D-157 — Wave 4 should remove alias |
| ADR-006..012 dependencies cited in stories | spec-drift-analyzer | NOT_STARTED | Verify Wave 3 ADR adoption is implicit |
| New ADRs needed for Wave 4? | architect | NOT_STARTED | Schedule semantics, detection rule lang, action delivery — likely require ADRs |
| Spec-first phasing (D-045 analog) decision | human | NOT_STARTED | Wave 3 was spec-first BLOCKING; Wave 4 may be too |
| Carry-forward debt placement | human | NOT_STARTED | Determine which W3 carry-forward TDs become W4-FIX-* candidates |

### Spec-First Discipline (D-045 Analog) — Decision Required

Wave 3 was spec-first BLOCKING (Phase 3.A required full spec convergence + human approval before any implementation). Wave 4 question: are W4 stories sufficiently spec'd (drafted 2026-04-16, ADRs 011/012 cover harness + workspace), or do we need new ADRs for schedule semantics, detection rule language, action delivery framework, and case state machine?

**Human input required.** Default recommendation: light spec refresh + targeted new ADRs only if existing stories surface gaps.

### Architecture Gates (if Phase 4.A adopted)

1. ADR drafts for new architectural decisions (schedule, detection, action delivery)
2. BC drafts for new behavioral contracts (BC-4.x family)
3. 3-clean adversarial spec convergence
4. Consistency-validator fresh-context pass
5. Spec-reviewer sign-off
6. Input-hash drift check
7. Human approval gate

### Convergence Targets (Wave 4 Gate)

Mirror Wave 3 gate criteria:
- 3-clean adversarial integration gate window
- All sub-reviewers CLEAN (code, security, consistency, holdout)
- Holdout HS-OPS-001 or equivalent (TBD): mean >= 0.85, must-pass >= 18/30
- 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM at convergence

### Open Questions for Human Approval

1. **Spec-first BLOCKING (Phase 4.A) yes/no?**
2. **Which W3 carry-forward debt becomes W4-FIX-* vs deferred?**
3. **New ADRs needed** (schedule semantics, detection lang, action framework, case state machine)?
4. **Wave 4 wave-cycle name:** `wave-4-operations` — confirm?

### Wave 5 Prerequisite (DO NOT close in Wave 4)

TD-S-1.07-01 (P1): KeyringBackend production wire-up — must be resolved before Wave 5 gate closes.
