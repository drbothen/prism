# BC-2.02.006: Armis Centrix Field Mapping to OCSF (7 Data Sources)

## Description

> **Amendment — ADR-023 (PLUGIN-MIGRATION-001-G):** This BC previously described a
> hardcoded Rust mapper module (`prism-ocsf/src/mappers/armis.rs`). That
> implementation was deleted in PLUGIN-MIGRATION-001-C (PR #158). The field-mapping behavior
> described here is now delivered by `SpecDrivenMapper` reading `ocsf_field` column
> annotations from the Armis TOML sensor spec. The behavioral contract itself
> is unchanged — the same OCSF field mappings must be produced; they are now
> data-driven via TOML annotations per ADR-023 Rule 1.

`SpecDrivenMapper` reads `ocsf_field` column annotations from the Armis TOML sensor spec and converts records fetched via AQL GetSearch from 7 Armis sources to appropriate OCSF event classes. Key mappings are `ipaddress` → `device.ip`, `name` → `device.hostname`, alert severity → `severity_id`, and `riskLevel` → OCSF risk score fields. Armis-specific fields (`aqlResults`, `connectionType`, `riskFactors`) and records from sources with no dedicated OCSF class are preserved in `raw_extensions`. Timestamp fallback is used when no primary timestamp field exists.

## Preconditions
- An Armis record has been fetched via AQL GetSearch from one of the 7 sources
- Timestamp extraction used the per-source fallback chain successfully (or fell back to fetch timestamp)

## Postconditions
- Armis `ipaddress` maps to OCSF `device.ip`
- Armis `name` (device name) maps to OCSF `device.hostname`
- Armis alert severity maps to OCSF `severity_id`
- Armis `riskLevel` maps to OCSF risk score fields
- Armis-specific fields (e.g., `aqlResults`, `connectionType`, `riskFactors`) are preserved in `raw_extensions`
- Each of the 7 Armis sources maps to an appropriate OCSF event class

## Invariants
- DI-005: OCSF schema validity

## Error Cases
| Error | Condition | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Warning | Armis record missing all timestamp fallback fields | OCSF `time` set to fetch timestamp; warning logged (DEC-013) |
| Warning | Armis severity/risk value in unexpected format | Best-effort mapping; unrecognized values go to `raw_extensions` |

## Edge Cases
| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-02-009 | Armis `connections` records (network flow data) | Mapped to OCSF Network Activity class; source/destination IPs extracted from connection fields |
| EC-02-010 | Armis `risk_factors` records (metadata about risk scoring) | Mapped to generic OCSF event; risk factor details in `raw_extensions` for agent consumption |

## Canonical Test Vectors

| Test Vector ID | Description | Expected |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| TV-BC-2.02.006-001 | Armis alert with ipaddress, name, severity | `device.ip`, `device.hostname`, `severity_id` set correctly |
| TV-BC-2.02.006-002 | Armis device with riskLevel | `riskLevel` mapped to OCSF risk score fields |
| TV-BC-2.02.006-003 | Armis connections record | Mapped to Network Activity class; source/dest IPs extracted |
| TV-BC-2.02.006-004 | Record missing all timestamp fallback fields | `time` = fetch timestamp; warning logged |
| TV-BC-2.02.006-005 | Severity in unexpected format | Best-effort mapping; unrecognized in `raw_extensions`; warning logged |

## Verification Properties

| VP | Verification Aspect |
|----|---------------------|
| VP-016 | OCSF normalization: output is valid protobuf (proptest) |
| VP-017 | OCSF normalization: unmapped fields preserved (proptest) |

## Traceability
